        <p>Gandhi's leadership in India's struggle for independence was marked by his unwavering commitment to nonviolence and civil disobedience. Through transformative campaigns like the Salt March, where he led thousands on a 240-mile journey to protest British salt taxes, and the Non-Cooperation Movement, which saw Indians boycotting British institutions, Gandhi displayed the power of nonviolent resistance in challenging colonial rule. His pivotal role in the Quit India Movement, a nationwide call for British withdrawal from India, further galvanized the nation's resolve for freedom.

        <h2>Champion of Nonviolent Resistance</h2>
        <p>Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance, known as Satyagraha, became the cornerstone of his activism. He advocated that truth and nonviolence were potent weapons to combat injustice and oppression. Throughout his life, Gandhi applied Satyagraha in various movements, including championing the rights of Indian indentured laborers in South Africa and leading protests against British policies in India. One of his most famous demonstrations of nonviolent resistance was the historic Dandi March, where he and his followers marched to the Arabian Sea to produce salt in defiance of the British salt monopoly.
